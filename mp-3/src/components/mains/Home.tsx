                    My name is Hiya Verma. I am a third year Data Science student. I am currently seeking a
                    summer internship. I am looking for a role where I can make a meaningful contribution while
                    also learned from seasoned industry professionals.

                Welcome to my website! You can find my educational history
                <strong><em><u><a href="edu.html">here</a></u></em></strong>
                and my employment history
                <strong><em><u><a href="emp.html">here</a></u></em></strong>
                — as well as other information that might be
                of interest to you.<br><br> A little bit about me: My academic journey, 
                which began with a focus on Applied Mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, 
                has evolved into a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to 
                solve complex problems. I am particularly interested in the 
                intersection of Artificial Intelligence and user experience, 
                as seen through my work with machine learning algorithms and 
                natural language processing.Whether I am building sustainability
                apps like MoveGreen at hackathons or tutoring students in advanced 
                mathematics, I am driven by a desire to create tools that make a 
                meaningful impact.
